## Halo, Apa Kabar?

> Hello, how are you?

My name is Febryandana. Born in one of the smallest city in Indonesia: Kota Mojokerto. I love learning computer stuff. But I'm such a generalist that didn't master only one thing. I like to learning whatever pick my interest. Infrastructure engineering, network, cloud, DevOps, etc.

In this digital era, I realize that everything would need computerization and internet. And I want to be a part of it, to be someone useful. Hence why I trying to learn computer stuff, network infrastructure, devops, system administration, etc.

Apart from those, I also like to juggling with IoT, microcontroller, and stuff. I love to create something, even if it's useless. Because that way I can try to make something new. Something that maybe useful.

So, there you have it... enjoy!

Salam kenal dan terima kasih!

> Nice to meet you and thank you!
