          Halo, Apa Kabar? #   Hello, how are you?
 My name is Febryandana. Born in one of the smallest city in Indonesia: Kota Mojokerto. I love learning computer stuff. But I&amp;rsquo;m such a generalist that didn&amp;rsquo;t master only one thing. I like to learning whatever pick my interest. Infrastructure engineering, network, cloud, DevOps, etc.
In this digital era, I realize that everything would need computerization and internet. And I want to be a part of it, to be someone useful.

          Personal #  My name is Moch. Febryandana Nurfahri.
I am a modest person who always focus on getting maximum results in any activities. I like to learn new things about computer and cloud technology. I believe that whoever does something persistently will succeed.
Experiences #    Capture the Flag - House of Technology 4.0 (October 2021 - November 2021)
As a lead cloud engineer, I supervised my team to manage cloud infrastructures to host CTF platform and challenges for national-scale event with more than 80 participants.
